Authentication and Authorization: While not explicitly represented in the ERD, user authentication and authorization mechanisms are essential components of the system's functionality, ensuring secure access to user accounts and resources.

Normalization: Ensure that the ERD follows normalization principles to minimize redundancy and maintain data integrity.

By representing these entities and their relationships in the ERD, the StudyNotion system can effectively model the data structure and relationships required to support the platform's functionalities, facilitating efficient data management and system operations.
